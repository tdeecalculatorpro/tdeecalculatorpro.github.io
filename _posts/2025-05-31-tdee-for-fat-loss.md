If you have ever attempted to lose weight by just cutting calories and saw little progress, you are not the only one. Most people focus only on eating less when losing weight, but it’s really about eating wisely and this is where your TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) is important.

This guide will show you what TDEE is, how it functions and how to use it to build a lasting fat-loss plan that really works.

## What Is TDEE and Why It Matters  

![tdee-fat-loss](/assets/images/tdee-fat-loss.jpg)

TDEE is the total amount of calories your body uses in a day. This includes:

- **BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)**: The amount of energy your body uses just to keep you alive (e.g., breathing and digesting).  
- **TEF (Thermic Effect of Food)**: Energy spent on breaking down the food you eat.  
- **NEAT (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis)**: Examples are walking, cleaning and fidgeting.  
- **EAT (Exercise Activity Thermogenesis)**: Calories you use up when you exercise or work out.

Your TDEE helps you see how many calories your body really needs. When you figure this out, you can start creating a plan to help you lose fat by reducing your calories.

## TDEE vs BMR: What's the Difference?  
Imagine that BMR is the number of calories your body would use to stay alive if you were to rest all day. It does not require any type of physical motion.

Alternatively, TDEE is your BMR plus the energy you use for movement, exercise and digestion. TDEE, therefore, shows you the total energy you need every day.

## How to Calculate Your TDEE  
Let’s go over the main steps in a simple way:

1. You can use the **Mifflin-St Jeor Equation** to find out your BMR:  
   - **Men**: `10 × weight (kg) + 6.25 × height (cm) – 5 × age + 5`  
   - **Women**: `10 × weight (kg) + 6.25 × height (cm) – 5 × age – 161`

2. Take your BMR and multiply it by your **Activity Level**:

| Activity Level               | Multiplier |
|-----------------------------|------------|
| Sedentary (little exercise) | 1.2        |
| Lightly active (1–3 days/wk)| 1.375      |
| Moderately active (3–5 days)| 1.55       |
| Very active (6–7 days)      | 1.725      |
| Extra active (athletes)     | 1.9        |

3. **Example**: If your BMR is 1,500 and you are moderately active, your TDEE = `1,500 × 1.55 = 2,325 calories/day`.

## How to Use TDEE for Fat Loss  
You need to eat less than your TDEE to lose fat which is known as a **caloric deficit**. A good way to begin is by eating **10–20% less** than your TDEE.

- **Mild deficit (10%)** = fat loss that occurs gradually and lasts over time  
- **Moderate deficit (20%)** = more rapid fat loss, higher possibility of losing muscle  

**Example**:  
If you need 2,400 calories to maintain your weight:  
- 10% deficit = **2,160 calories/day**  
- 20% deficit = **1,920 calories/day**

## Fat Loss Without Muscle Loss: Pro Tips  
To keep your muscles and energy up when you are eating fewer calories:

- Consume **1.0–1.2 grams of protein** for every pound of your weight  
- Try to **strength train at least 3–5 days** each week  
- Ensure you are getting **enough sleep (7–9 hours)** each night  
- You might also want to take **Whey Protein** or **Omega-3 (Krill Oil)** for additional help

## When to Recalculate TDEE  
When you lose weight or exercise more, your TDEE can change. You should recalculate your TDEE **every 4–6 weeks** or whenever you stop seeing progress.

Tell the truth about your physical activity and notice how your energy, hunger and body feel. Use your TDEE to give you an idea, but don’t treat it as something you must follow exactly.

## FAQs  
**What is the best way to calculate my TDEE?**  
You can calculate TDEE by first estimating your BMR using the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation, then multiplying that result by your activity level (using a multiplier between 1.2 to 1.9 depending on how active you are). You can also use free TDEE calculators online for quick results.

**How much of a calorie deficit should I use for fat loss?**  
A safe and effective range is 10–20% below your TDEE. A 10% deficit leads to slower but more sustainable fat loss, while 20% yields faster results with a slightly higher risk of muscle loss.

**Can I lose fat without losing muscle?**  
Yes. To preserve muscle while losing fat, aim to eat enough protein (1.0–1.2g per pound of body weight), engage in strength training 3–5 times a week, and ensure sufficient sleep (7–9 hours per night).

**How often should I recalculate my TDEE?**  
You should reassess your TDEE every 4–6 weeks or when you experience a plateau in progress. As your weight or activity level changes, so does your energy expenditure.

**Is it okay to eat below my BMR for faster results?**  
No, eating below your BMR is not recommended. It can negatively affect your metabolism, cause fatigue, and lead to nutrient deficiencies. Always keep your intake above BMR and focus on a moderate deficit from your TDEE.

## Conclusion  
Using your TDEE is one of the best things you can do to lose fat over the long run. It takes out the guessing, keeps you away from crash diets and gives you more control.

If you use TDEE, focus on nutrition, work out and are consistent, you can lose fat without giving up meals or harming your metabolism. Stop the cycle of starting and stopping diets. No more stress. Be aware of the key figures in your business. Take charge of your own progress.
