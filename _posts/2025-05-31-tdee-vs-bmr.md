Weight loss, fitness and nutrition often mention two acronyms: BMR and TDEE. These terms are used a lot in diet plans, fitness apps and online tools, but lots of people don’t know what they mean or which one is best for their health.  

We should look at what BMR and TDEE are, why they are important and how they can assist you in managing your weight healthily.

## What is BMR?

![what-affects-bmr](/assets/images/what-affects-bmr.jpg)

BMR means Basal Metabolic Rate. It shows the amount of energy your body uses to do its simplest tasks at rest, for example, breathing, circulating blood, controlling temperature and digesting nutrients. Imagine that your body just needs this energy to keep you breathing while you are in bed all day.  

BMR is affected by several things about a person:
- Gender  
- Age  
- Weight  
- Height  
- Body composition (muscle mass vs fat mass)

The Mifflin-St Jeor Equation is the most often used formula for estimating BMR:
- **For women**: BMR = 10 x weight (kg) + 6.25 x height (cm) − 5 x age (years) – 161  
- **For men**: BMR = 10 x weight (kg) + 6.25 x height (cm) − 5 x age (years) + 5

*Example: A woman who is 28 years old, 69kg and 180cm tall has a BMR of approximately 1,514 calories/day.*  
BMR is a useful number, yet it doesn’t show your full calorie needs, because you’re rarely inactive all day.

## What is TDEE?
TDEE means Total Daily Energy Expenditure. It adds up the calories you burn from your BMR, exercise and the energy needed to digest food (TEF).

TDEE includes:
1. **BMR** – The minimum calories required to keep a person alive  
2. **TEF** – Energy needed to break down and digest food (~10% of total calories)  
3. **TEA** – The Thermic Effect of Activity (doing workouts or exercise)  
4. **NEAT** – Things like walking, fidgeting and doing chores are examples of Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis  

TDEE is found by multiplying your BMR by an activity factor:
- Sedentary (little or no exercise): BMR x 1.2  
- Lightly active (1–3 days/week): BMR x 1.375  
- Moderately active (3–5 days/week): BMR x 1.55  
- Very active (6–7 days/week): BMR x 1.725  
- Extra active (physical job + daily workouts): BMR x 1.9

*Example: If she is moderately active, her TDEE is estimated to be 2,346.7 calories/day.*

## Which One Should You Track—BMR or TDEE?
Although BMR is helpful, TDEE is the number you should focus on if you are trying to lose, maintain or add weight.  

Here’s why:
- BMR helps you find out your basic daily calorie needs.  
- TDEE measures your daily energy use which includes all your activities.

If you want to lose weight, keep your weight the same or build muscle, TDEE tells you how many calories your body uses and how much food you should eat.

## Using TDEE for Weight Loss
You need to eat less than your TDEE to lose weight. You can use a few safe methods to do this:
- **Moderate deficit (10–20% of TDEE)**: More healthy and less likely to lead to tiredness or a slow metabolism.  
- **500-calorie deficit/day**: It usually results in losing about 1lb (0.45kg) per week which is a common rule.

> *Caution: Don’t choose a calorie goal that is less than your BMR! This can lead to a slower metabolism and cause you to feel tired, cranky and have nutrient shortages.*

## Why BMR and TDEE Matter
Grasping these two figures can:
- Help you decide on a healthy number of calories to eat each day  
- Avoid both eating too little and eating too much  
- Choose a healthy diet over short-term fad diets  
- Help you understand why your weight is not dropping even though you count your calories

But it’s important to remember: BMR and TDEE are not exact numbers. They fail to consider hormone balance, how efficiently your body uses energy or any existing health problems. See them as guidance, not as strict guidelines.

## FAQs
**What is the main difference between BMR and TDEE?**  
BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) is the number of calories your body needs to function at rest, while TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) includes your BMR plus the calories burned through activity and digestion.

**Why is TDEE more useful than BMR for weight management?**  
TDEE gives a more complete picture of your daily calorie needs because it accounts for movement, workouts, and food digestion—making it a better guide for setting calorie goals.

**Can I eat below my BMR to lose weight faster?**  
It’s not recommended. Consistently eating below your BMR can slow your metabolism, reduce energy levels, and lead to nutrient deficiencies.

**How do I calculate my TDEE?**  
First, calculate your BMR using the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation. Then, multiply it by your activity factor (ranging from 1.2 to 1.9) depending on how active you are.

**How much of a calorie deficit is safe for weight loss?**  
A moderate calorie deficit of 10–20% below your TDEE or about 500 calories per day is typically safe and sustainable for most people.

## Conclusion
TDEE is the most important number to pay attention to when trying to manage your weight. It shows you the amount of energy your body uses and guides you to eat the right number of calories for your needs.  

Even so, don’t make numbers the main focus of your training. Health involves more than calories; it includes nutrients, balance, energy and how you feel in your body. Once you know your BMR and TDEE, you’re more likely to find a diet plan that meets your needs instead of making things harder for you.
